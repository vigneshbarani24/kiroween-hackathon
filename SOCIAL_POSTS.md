🚀 Solving Enterprise Software's $200B Problem with AI

I just completed my submission for the Kiroween Hackathon 2025, and it's been an incredible journey into the intersection of AI and legacy modernization.

**The Challenge:**
SAP ABAP (created 1983) powers critical systems at 25,000+ Fortune 500 companies. But there's a crisis:
- Developers are retiring (avg age 45+)
- Nobody's learning it (would you?)
- Migration projects cost $5-50M and take 2-3 years
- Enterprises are trapped in technical debt

**The Solution:**
Using Kiro's AI-powered development platform, I built a complete SAP modernization system that:
✅ Understands legacy ABAP code
✅ Transforms it to modern TypeScript/Python
✅ Preserves 100% of business logic
✅ Auto-validates with agent hooks
✅ Deploys to the cloud

**How Kiro Made It Possible:**

📋 **Specs:** I taught Kiro ABAP syntax once. It remembered.

🧭 **Steering Docs:** 40 years of SAP expertise in one markdown file. Kiro became an instant SAP expert.

🛡️ **Agent Hooks:** Automated quality validation. Kiro validates its own transformations.

🔧 **MCP:** Custom ABAP analysis tools. Extended Kiro's capabilities for legacy tech.

💬 **Vibe Coding:** Iterative conversations, not one-shot prompts. Built production-ready architecture through dialogue.

**The Impact:**
- Traditional approach: 2-3 weeks, $15k+ per module
- With Kiro: 10 seconds, ~$0.50 API call
- Business logic preservation: 100%

**Key Learning:**
AI doesn't just write code. When equipped with domain knowledge (specs + steering), automated quality checks (hooks), and custom capabilities (MCP), it becomes a true development partner.

For the "Resurrection" category, ABAP was perfect: dead technology (1983), brought back to life with AI.

This is what #hookedonkiro means to me. It changed how I approach complex, domain-specific problems.

Grateful to the @kirodotdev team for building an incredible platform and to Anthropic for Claude AI.
